WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net u8/real_imm_9_or0000 is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net u7/ND_cmp_eq0000 is sourced
   by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net u13/outre_15_or0001 is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <clk_IBUF> is incomplete. The signal
   does not drive any load pins in the design.
DRC detected 0 errors and 4 warnings.  Please see the previously displayed
